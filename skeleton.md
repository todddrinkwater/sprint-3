What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

When the browser shrinks smaller than 550px then containers rearrange so that content becomes stacked on top of each other to make it more user friendly for mobile devices.

The reason for the rearrangement is due to the use of media queries in the CSS code. The use of the element tells browsers that when a browser window is greater or smaller than a certain size to rescale or adjust the content as specified in the properties of the element.
